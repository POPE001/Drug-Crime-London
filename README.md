# GIS Analysis with Crime Data

This Jupyter Notebook provides a walkthrough of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with crime data. It covers various aspects, including data preprocessing, visualization, time series analysis, and machine learning.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, sklearn, folium, and tensorflow

```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn folium tensorflow
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository containing the data and this Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open this notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Loading and Preprocessing Data

This section covers data loading, handling, and preprocessing. It includes:

- Mounting Google Drive to access data files.
- Loading the crime dataset (`MPS Monthly Crime Dashboard_BoroughSNT_TNOCrimeDatafy22-23_03.csv`).
- Converting the 'Month_Year' column to a datetime format.
- Handling missing data.

## Geographic Visualization

In this section, you'll learn how to visualize geographic data. It includes:

- Loading London boroughs' geojson data.
- Preparing the data for geographic visualization.
- Creating choropleth maps to visualize drug crime rates in different boroughs.

## Temporal Analysis

This section covers time series analysis, including:

- Decomposing the time series to understand trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- Filtering and visualizing drug-related offenses.
- Analyzing temporal trends of drug-related crimes.
- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Analysis.

## Time Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting is performed using ARIMA and LSTM models. This includes:

- Model creation and training using ARIMA and LSTM.
- Forecasting the next three months of drug-related crimes.
- Evaluating model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualizing the predictions.

## High-Risk Area Identification

Identifying areas with significant deviations between actual and predicted crime counts. Includes:

- Identifying high-risk areas.
- Statistical analysis of high-risk areas, including mean, median, and standard deviation.
- Temporal trend visualization of high-risk areas.

## Model Comparison

Comparing the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models. Includes:

- Evaluating and comparing MAE, MSE, and RMSE of both models.
- Visualizing predictions for comparison.

## Geographic Crime Map

Generating a geographic crime map using Folium. Includes:

- Creating a base map of London.
- Adding a choropleth layer with crime rates by borough.
- Saving and displaying the interactive map.
